--- RUNNING CODE ---
open processDataScriptExcel.m
change the dropbox path to make it work for your computer
run processDataScriptExcel.m


--- HOW THE GUI WORKS ---
Right now you can move to the next valid maze test by clicking the "Next Test" button.
You can make modifications to the maze (x shift, y shift, rotate, clip data)
Notes: There is no "scale" function. This is because I'm worried about misrepresenting the data. I could easily add a scaling function though.
Notes: "Flatten data" doesn't work unfortunately (having issues since sometimes you need to rotate +, sometimes -), but I don't think it's necessary (when the rotation does work, it hardly makes a difference).

--- WHAT EACH FILE DOES --

processDataScriptExcel.m --- a wrapped script for process_tango_data_excel.m

process_tango_data_excel.m --- the gui for processing the data

plot_maze.m --- function that plots one of 4 mazes

findTestData.m --- given data from the excel spreadsheet, it parses through the data and returns only the tests that should be processed

rotatePoints.m --- function for rotating a matrix
